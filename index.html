<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>Our goal is to use modern AI tools to design antiviral agents against FMD â€“ a disease that threatens livestock worldwide and causes enormous economic losses each year.</p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Analyzing the structure of the FMD virus</li>
<li>Designing and optimizing antiviral molecules using AI</li>
<li>Virtual testing of efficacy (QSAR, docking)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Looking for Partners</h2>
<p>We are seeking academic collaborators, grant cooperation, and laboratories for molecular validation. The project has the potential to grow into a commercially viable solution with a strong impact on the veterinary and agricultural sector.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What is Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD)?</h3>
<p>A highly contagious viral disease affecting cattle, pigs, and sheep. Outbreaks often lead to mass culling of animals, causing devastating losses for farmers and governments.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Why isn't there an effective treatment yet?</h3>
<p>No antiviral drug exists yet. Vaccines exist but have limitations â€“ such as trade restrictions. In many cases, itâ€™s more economical for countries to cull animals than to vaccinate.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What is the role of AI in this?</h3>
<p>Think of it as a smart virtual scientist â€“ AI analyzes data about the virus and proposes molecular structures that could block or neutralize it. We can simulate and screen thousands of molecules quickly and cost-effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Why now?</h3>
<p>Modern AI tools are ready. We have the data. The virus is resurfacing. Now is the time to act with a tech-driven approach that wasnâ€™t possible a few years ago.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Whatâ€™s your role in the project?</h3>
<p>Iâ€™m the project initiator â€“ I connect research, technology, and funding. My aim is to bring together the right experts and tools to make the project real.</p>
